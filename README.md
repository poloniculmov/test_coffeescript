test_coffeescript
=================

So I was reading [Testing with coffeescript](https://efendibooks.com/minibooks/testing-with-coffeescript) and I thought to myself [<strike>What the fuck</strike>](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsIgSusKrR8&feature=related), maybe I should write some code. So i did. 

I didn't enjoy the minibook, it's not well written and there are some typos, even in the code, and the code doesn't seem very idiomatic to me.  It's good enough if you've never used Jasmine before, but I was more interested on idiomatic Coffescript in a TDD environement.
